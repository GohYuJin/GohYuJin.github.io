    review: "I highly recommend Yujin for his exceptional expertise in Python programming, machine learning, \
              and data optimization. His unwavering commitment to excellence and eagerness to share his knowledge has left a \
              profound impact on my learning journey and the coding aspect of my PhD studies.\
              \n\n \
              During a particularly challenging section of my code, Yujin helped me with an impressive depth of \
              understanding in Python programming. He not only helped me identify and resolve complex issues in my \
              code but also patiently guided me through the debugging process, ensuring that I grasped the underlying concepts. \
              \n\n \
              What sets Yujin apart is his ability to break down complex concepts into understandable components, \
              making it easy for those around them to learn and grow. His dedication to collaboration and knowledge sharing \
              has not only strengthened my technical skills but also inspired me to tackle more ambitious projects for my \
              academic pursuit with confidence. \
              \n\n \
              I am genuinely grateful for Yujin's support, patience, and expertise. \
              His invaluable contributions to my PhD Studies have not only resolved technical roadblocks \
              but have also enriched my understanding of Python programming and machine learning. Without a doubt, \
              Yujin is an asset to any team and an individual whose commitment to excellence is truly commendable.",

    review: "Yu Jin is one of the most outstanding, talented individuals I have come across. \
              He's an extremely fast learner - having mastered java and python before commencing his studies at SUTD,\
              he served the role of a teaching assistant under our common mentor, where he taught \
              Python, Tableau, Java, WEKA and R to a class of Master students. He's one of the rare people you d come\
              across that simply excels at every thing he does. \
              Someone you can definitely rely on - an asset to any team!",
