      review: "Yu Jin is one of the most outstanding, talented individuals I have come across. \
              Heâ€™s an extremely fast learner - having mastered java and python before commencing his studies at SUTD,\
              he served the role of a teaching assistant under our common mentor, where he taught \
              Python, Tableau, Java, WEKA and R to a class of Master students. Heâ€™s one of the rare people youâ€™d come\
              across that simply excels at every thing he does. \
              Someone you can definitely rely on - an asset to any team!",
